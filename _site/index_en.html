<p>The Alumni Matematica Verona association is open!</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>Because we are all spread in a diversity of social, professional and geographical contexts. This variety of experiences will be the basis on which the life of the association will be set.</p>

<p>For us teachers, pure and/or applied researchers and professional mathematicians, the act of associating answers three important necessities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first concerns the alumni that took the path leading to teaching. We believe in the fundamental importance of creating the place and the chance to share the experiences accumulated in the classroom in order to pave the way for the most recent graduates that want to follow the same path. Finally, the association will be the occasion for the experienced lecturer to develop and improve its own teaching methods by discussing them with his fellow alumni.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second necessity involves the alumni working in pure and applied research. For them the association will be the perfect place to talk about and exchange ideas. The communication barriers that we usually encounter in professional contexts will be broken by the common academic background shared among all the fellows. The association proposes itself as the place where this union is maintained after the end of the academic adventure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third necessity comes from the corporate world. The association has the goal to facilitate the communication between the alumni working in this context and to help them seeing the future of the state of the art, the technologies and the challenges faced every day in the field. In this way, those who participate at the life of the association will always be able to express their professional value at its best.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="who">Who</h3>

<p>Those who have been enrolled in at least among the bachelor, master and the doctoral programs in mathematics of the University of Verona.</p>

<h3 id="where">Where</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Verona. When we will meet, it will be in the city where we studied together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everywhere. We will share a wide virtual space.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>

<p>Very soon it will be possible to become a member of the association. <a href="http://eepurl.com/gv9u9D">Click here to subscribe to the mailing list</a>. We swear we send very few emails that will concern only the activities of the association.</p>
